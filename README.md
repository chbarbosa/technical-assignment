# technical assignment
This is a technical assignment requested by a company.

## usage
You must run the **ServingWebContentApplication** class to start the application. Use <http://localhost:8080> to access the application.
You have **two options**: check the closest stores or check all registered stores organized by city.
The closest stores option will find the stores by the geolocation position informed by the browser or by the position informed by the user.

### future improvements
* Break the StoresController in controllers per pages.
* Change the w3 css, maybe for tailwindcss.
* Add statistics.
* Add filter for cities page to make easy to find one.
* Redesign the first page.
